My name is Konstantin Engelmayer, and I am a Master’s student of Physical Geography at Marburg University. As I spent a lot of time in nature, I have developed a deep appreciation for the environment and its conservation. This passion continuously drives and inspires not only my personal interests, but also my academic pursuits. Thus, I have specialized in the analysis of the impact of human activities on nature using remote sensing techniques, statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. 

The visualization of spatial relationships to generate broad-scale knowledge with the aim to inform nature conservation management represents one of my key points of interest and expertise. I thereby seek to support environmental conservation and sustainable resource management by quantifying and visualizing human impact on natural ecosystems. Through this type of work, I aim to make a meaningful contribution to preserving the natural world that has always been so important to me.
